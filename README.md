# Home Assistant Blueprints

I have been using Home Assistant for 10+ years, it's about time I started to contribute to help other users. 
I have these blueprints that may help some other people:

* [Cast to Google Hub](#cast-to-google-hub)
* [Motion Lights - Any Brightness](#motion-lights-any)
* [Motion Lights - Sun/Lux dependant](#motion-lights-sun-lux)

##  <a name="motion-lights-any"/> Motion Lights - Any Brightness
This is just a simple script I created to control my lights based upon motion.

## <a name="motion-lights-sun-lux"/> Motion Lights - Sun/Lux dependant
This is just a simple script I created to control my lights based upon motion/lux/sun rise/sun set.

## <a name="cast-to-google-hub"/> Cast to Google Hub
I created this script originally to cast my picture frame dashboard on my Google Home Hubs. But then I realised I could write it in a more generic way so it can be used with any dashboard instead.
